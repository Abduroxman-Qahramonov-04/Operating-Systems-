Exercise 02
-------------

Permissions management

Verify and reply to the following questions:
- the username and the group to which you belong.
Is it possible to modify them?
  
who
groups

Yes, it is possible to modify them if the user has the rights.

- the position of your home directory within the file system hierarchy of the system you are using

ls /home

- the structure of your /home directory (e.g., its subdirectories, etc.)

ls /home  

- the rights of reading and writing on the various directories of the file system. Is it possible to modify access rights to your home directory?

ls -l /home

cd /home/user1

ls -l /home/user1

etc etc 


- what happens if reading or execution rights are eliminated for a directory. Use both the octal notation (e.g., “654”) and the one based on characters (e.g., ”+uw-gx“) to modify the rights.
How is it possible to modify in the same way the access rights to all the files and directories of a directory tree (for example, to eliminate the read right to all, user, group, and other of the directory osEx01backup)? 

  Suggestion: man chmod ... recursive ...


  chmod -r a-r soEx01backup
