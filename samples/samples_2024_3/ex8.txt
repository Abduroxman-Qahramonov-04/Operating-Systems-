Describe the problem of the Readers and Writers in the case of precedence to Readers. Indicate the meaning
of the various synchronization primitives used.

Readers and Writers is one of the synchronization problems, where multiple readears can read the critical section at the
same time if no writer is accesing it.When writer is using critical section no other reader or writer should access it.
As for precedence to reader, it means prioritizing reader processes over writer processes when accessing a shared resource

nR=0

init (meR, 1)
inti (meW,1)
init (w,1)

//Reader
wait(meR)
nR++
if(nR == 1){
    wait(w);
}
signal(meR)
//reading
wait(meR)
nR--
if(nR == 0){
    signal(w)
}
signal(meR)


//Writer 
wait(meW)
wait(w)
//writing
signal(w)
signal(meW);
