As the name implies First process that comes in the queue will be served first.Let's instantiate queue effeft with an example:

Process AT  BT
P1      0   10
P2      2   5
P3      4   1

Since P3 joined the gruop altough it has the least burst time, waiting time will be longer than other two process.This is the clear example 
of queue effect.

And another example where the same FCFS algorithm will be used but queue won't occur, as the burst time of process that joined the queue
is not that long:

Process AT  BT
P1      0   2
P2      2   1
P3      4   9

But this problem will not occur when SJF algorithm is used because it only takes into consideration the arrival time when the 
burst time of process equal otherwise the process that has the least burst time will be served.
